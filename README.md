# Lab | MS Excel Formulas

### Exercise 1

In the `Formula.xlsx` which can be downloaded from [your-code folder](./your-code/Formula.xlsx), we have a dataset with Customer personal and assurance product information. The columns ST, Gender and Education take values no homogenized. 

For example, Gender column takes the values NA, F, Femal, female, M, Male. In this exercise, you must create 3 new columns with these values standardized. So Gender_new only takes F, M or NA. You can use all the formulas we saw today. 
Probably, there are multiple ways to achieve your target, all of them are correct.

### Exercise 2

Customer lifetime value, through its name, we can consider as a number or a quantity, not a percentage. Correct the column format using text formulas.

Number of Complaints also seems to be a numerical variable. Correct it!

### Exercise 3

All the policy types contain the word "Auto". Create a new variable containing only the first word and eliminate "Auto".

### Exercise 4

Create a new column called "Number of doors" using vehicle class. Luxury cars are considered with only two doors, and SUVs have four doors.

### Exercise 5

Calculate the duration of the assurances in years subtracting the "date" column to today.
